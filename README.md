Parallel implementation of the BWA DNA alignment software

## Introduction

pBWA is a parallel implementation of the popular software BWA. It was developed by modifying the BWA source code with the OpenMPI C library on the SHARCNET. pBWA has been successfully tested on other systems with the most basic OpenMPI installs. pBWA currently implements three commands from BWA: aln, samse, and sampe. pBWA retains and improves upon the multithreading provided by BWA while adding efficient parallelization for the above listed functions. pBWA has shown that its wall-time speedup is bounded only by the size of the parallel system available as pBWA can run on any number of nodes and/or cores simultaneously.


## Requirements

pBWA requires a multi-node (or multi-core) *nix system with a parallel scheduler alongside the OpenMPI C library in order to compile and run. Each processor executing pBWA requires as much RAM as BWA requires given the same dataset and parameters. pBWA requires an index generated by BWA for each genome it wishes to align to.
